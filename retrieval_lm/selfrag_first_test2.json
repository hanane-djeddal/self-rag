NBC kept it because \"Bonanza\" was one of the first series to be filmed and broadcast in color, including scenes of picturesque Lake Tahoe, Nevada, although most of the episodes were obviously filmed on soundstages until the seasons near the end of the series. NBC's corporate parent, Radio Corporation of America (RCA), used the show to spur sales of RCA-manufactured color television sets (RCA was also the primary sponsor of the series during its first two seasons)."}, "parent": 0, "overall_score_dict": {"0": {"final_score": 1.9420463541779382, "relevance_score": 0.9996017869413117, "ground_score": 0.9424445672366265, "utility_score": 0.0, "relevance_score_dict": {"0": {"[Irrelevant]": 0.00039821219431360975, "[Relevant]": 0.9995996171718717}, "1": {"[Irrelevant]": 0.002888395837004239, "[Relevant]": 0.996701428286669}, "2": {"[Irrelevant]": 0.0020189142199848304, "[Relevant]": 0.9979317139851046}, "3": {"[Irrelevant]": 0.00043861238136040865, "[Relevant]": 0.998575216869825}}, "grd_score_dict": {"0": {"[Fully supported]": 0.8955588089446801, "[Partially supported]": 0.0879822706170253, "[No support / Contradictory]": 0.013387521775643028}, "1": {"[Fully supported]": 0.9087565396957943, "[Partially supported]": 0.02153952647425421, "[No support / Contradictory]": 0.04385230083104257}, "2": {"[Fully supported]": 0.7971884091279201, "[Partially supported]": 0.11131243468173066, "[No support / Contradictory]": 0.08402303389158494}, "3": {"[Fully supported]": 0.996727600654277, "[Partially supported]": 0.0018504243670076851, "[No support / Contradictory]": 0.0009827529630318979}}, "ut_score_dict": 0.0}, "1": {"final_score": 1.9410388122612057, "relevance_score": 0.9971104189265467, "ground_score": 0.9439283933346588, "utility_score": 0.0, "relevance_score_dict": {"0": {"[Irrelevant]": 0.00039821219431360975, "[Relevant]": 0.9995996171718717}, "1": {"[Irrelevant]": 0.002888395837004239, "[Relevant]": 0.996701428286669}, "2": {"[Irrelevant]": 0.0020189142199848304, "[Relevant]": 0.9979317139851046}, "3": {"[Irrelevant]": 0.00043861238136040865, "[Relevant]": 0.998575216869825}}, "grd_score_dict": {"0": {"[Fully supported]": 0.8955588089446801, "[Partially supported]": 0.0879822706170253, "[No support / Contradictory]": 0.013387521775643028}, "1": {"[Fully supported]": 0.9087565396957943, "[Partially supported]": 0.02153952647425421, "[No support / Contradictory]": 0.04385230083104257}, "2": {"[Fully supported]": 0.7971884091279201, "[Partially supported]": 0.11131243468173066, "[No support / Contradictory]": 0.08402303389158494}, "3": {"[Fully supported]": 0.996727600654277, "[Partially supported]": 0.0018504243670076851, "[No support / Contradictory]": 0.0009827529630318979}}, "ut_score_dict": 0.0}, "2": {"final_score": 1.8572496098853881, "relevance_score": 0.9979809860976749, "ground_score": 0.8592686237877132, "utility_score": 0.0, "relevance_score_dict": {"0": {"[Irrelevant]": 0.00039821219431360975, "[Relevant]": 0.9995996171718717}, "1": {"[Irrelevant]": 0.002888395837004239, "[Relevant]": 0.996701428286669}, "2": {"[Irrelevant]": 0.0020189142199848304, "[Relevant]": 0.9979317139851046}, "3": {"[Irrelevant]": 0.00043861238136040865, "[Relevant]": 0.998575216869825}}, "grd_score_dict": {"0": {"[Fully supported]": 0.8955588089446801, "[Partially supported]": 0.0879822706170253, "[No support / Contradictory]": 0.013387521775643028}, "1": {"[Fully supported]": 0.9087565396957943, "[Partially supported]": 0.02153952647425421, "[No support / Contradictory]": 0.04385230083104257}, "2": {"[Fully supported]": 0.7971884091279201, "[Partially supported]": 0.11131243468173066, "[No support / Contradictory]": 0.08402303389158494}, "3": {"[Fully supported]": 0.996727600654277, "[Partially supported]": 0.0018504243670076851, "[No support / Contradictory]": 0.0009827529630318979}}, "ut_score_dict": 0.0}, "3": {"final_score": 1.997652151109881, "relevance_score": 0.999560954644953, "ground_score": 0.9980911964649282, "utility_score": 0.0, "relevance_score_dict": {"0": {"[Irrelevant]": 0.00039821219431360975, "[Relevant]": 0.9995996171718717}, "1": {"[Irrelevant]": 0.002888395837004239, "[Relevant]": 0.996701428286669}, "2": {"[Irrelevant]": 0.0020189142199848304, "[Relevant]": 0.9979317139851046}, "3": {"[Irrelevant]": 0.00043861238136040865, "[Relevant]": 0.998575216869825}}, "grd_score_dict": {"0": {"[Fully supported]": 0.8955588089446801, "[Partially supported]": 0.0879822706170253, "[No support / Contradictory]": 0.013387521775643028}, "1": {"[Fully supported]": 0.9087565396957943, "[Partially supported]": 0.02153952647425421, "[No support / Contradictory]": 0.04385230083104257}, "2": {"[Fully supported]": 0.7971884091279201, "[Partially supported]": 0.11131243468173066, "[No support / Contradictory]": 0.08402303389158494}, "3": {"[Fully supported]": 0.996727600654277, "[Partially supported]": 0.0018504243670076851, "[No support / Contradictory]": 0.0009827529630318979}}, "ut_score_dict": 0.0}}, "processed_pred": "Bonanza was filmed in the United States, in the states of Nevada and California."}, "2": {"prompt": "### Instruction:\nAnswer the following question.

In 1931, NBC was able to purchase Chicago radio station WENR from financially troubled Samuel Insull. Later in the year, it bought WMAQ from the \"Daily News\". With the purchase of WMAQ, the network now owned a radio station in Chicago for their Blue Network (WENR) and their Red Network (WMAQ).

Demographic studies of wild giraffes living inside and outside protected areas suggest low adult survival outside protected areas due to poaching, and low calf survival inside protected areas due to predation are the primary influences on population growth rates. Survival of giraffe calves is influenced by the season of birth, and the seasonal local presence or absence of long-distance migratory herds of wildebeest and zebra. Metapopulation analysis indicated protected areas were important for keeping giraffes in the larger landscape. \"In situ\" conservation of Masai giraffes is being done by several government agencies including Kenya Wildlife Service, Tanzania National Parks, Zambia Wildlife Authority; and non-governmental organizations including PAMS Foundation, and Wild Nature Institute.

Most top class sports car races emphasize endurance (typically between 2.5\u201324 hours), reliability, and strategy, over pure speed. Longer races usually involve complex pit strategy and regular driver changes.

Many theories have been advanced as to why the Congress settled on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.

The bill initially set the day for choosing presidential electors on \"the first Tuesday in November,\" in years divisible by four (1848, 1852, etc.). But it was pointed out that in some years the period between the first Tuesday in November and the first Wednesday in December (when the electors are required to meet in their state capitals to vote) would be more than 34 days, in violation of the existing Electoral College law. So, the bill was reworded to move the date for choosing presidential electors to the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, a date scheme already used in New York.

Many theories have been advanced as to why the Congress settled on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The actual reasons, as shown in records of Congressional debate on the bill in December 1844, were fairly prosaic. The bill initially set the day for choosing presidential electors on \"the first Tuesday in November,\" in years divisible by four (1848, 1852, etc.). But it was pointed out that in some years the period between the first Tuesday in November and the first Wednesday in December (when the electors are required to meet in their state capitals to vote) would be more than 34 days, in violation of the existing Electoral College law. So, the bill was reworded to move the date for choosing presidential electors to the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, a date scheme already used in New York. The period between Election Day and the first Wednesday in December is always 29 days. The effect of the change was to make November 2 the earliest day on which Election Day may fall."}], "intermediate": ["[Retrieval]", "The first Tuesday after the first Monday in November was chosen as Election Day by the United States Congress in 1845."]}, {"query_id": "3337", "query": "Where is Salvija Square located?", "quotes": [{"idx": 1, "docid": "4968316#0", "text": "Slavija Square () is a major commercial junction, situated between the intersections of Kralja Milana, Beogradska, Makenzijeva, Svetosavska, Bulevar oslobo\u0111enja, Deligradska and Nemanjina streets in Belgrade.

They were established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which dictates that the awards should be administered by the Nobel Foundation. Another prize, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, was established in 1968 by the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, for contributors to the field of economics. Each prize is awarded by a separate committee; the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, and Economics, the Karolinska Institute awards the Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Prize in Peace. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a cash prize that has varied throughout the years. In 1901, the winners of the first Nobel Prizes were given 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. In 2008, the winners were awarded a prize amount of 10,000,000 SEK.

In 1920, during the Polish-Bolshevik War, the Polish Ministry of Interior decided to nationalize the unit. However, the authorities of Warsaw have sued the state authorities and the decision was withdrawn. Until World War II the Warsaw Fire Guards were the only privately owned fire brigade in Poland and one of the very few such units in the world. Officially their status was similar to that of the Municipal Police. The private ownership (most of the shares were held by the city of Warsaw) allowed for fast modernization of the Guards. In 1928 the last horse-drawn cart was decommissioned; since then the Guard has been fully motorized.

The absence of his forces at the battle has been the subject of dispute. A perception arose that his absence was due to his desire to achieve 'military glory' at Lw\u00f3w. Telegrams concerning the transfer of forces were exchanged. Leon Trotsky interpreted Stalin's actions as insubordination; Richard Pipes asserts that Stalin '...almost certainly acted on Lenin's orders' in not moving the forces to Warsaw. That the commander-in-chief Sergey Kamenev allowed such insubordination, issued conflicting and confusing orders and did not act with the decisiveness of a commander-in-chief contributed greatly to the problems and defeat the Red forces suffered at this critical junction of the war. The Polish 5th Army under General W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski counter-attacked on 14 August from the area of the Modlin fortress, crossing the Wkra River. It faced the combined forces of the numerically and materially superior Soviet 3rd and 15th Armies. In one day the Soviet advance toward Warsaw and Modlin had been halted and soon turned into retreat. Sikorski's 5th Army pushed the exhausted Soviet formations away from Warsaw in a lightning operation. Polish forces advanced at a speed of thirty kilometers a day, soon destroying any Soviet hopes for completing their enveloping manoeuvre in the north. By 16 August, the Polish counter-offensive had been fully joined by Marshal Pi\u0142sudski's \"Reserve Army.\" Precisely executing his plan, the Polish force, advancing from Warsaw (Colonel Wrzali\u0144ski's group) and the south (Polish 3rd and 4 Army), found a huge gap between the Soviet fronts and exploited the weakness of the Soviet \"Mozyr Group\" that was supposed to protect the weak link between the Soviet fronts. The Poles continued their northward offensive with two armies following and destroying the surprised enemy. They reached the rear of Tukhachevsky's forces, the majority of which were encircled by 18 August. Only that same day did Tukhachevsky, at his Minsk headquarters 480 kilometres (300 mi) east of Warsaw, become fully aware of the proportions of the Soviet defeat and ordered the remnants of his forces to retreat and regroup. He hoped to straighten his front line, halt the Polish attack, and regain the initiative, but the orders either arrived too late or failed to arrive at all."}, {"idx": 4, "docid": "376841#47", "text": "One of the reasons given for the collapse of the Uprising was the reluctance of the Soviet Red Army to help the Polish resistance. On 1 August, the day of Uprising, the Soviet advance was halted by a direct order from the Kremlin. Soon afterwards the Soviet tank units stopped receiving any oil from their depots. Soviets knew of the planned outbreak from their agents in Warsaw and, more importantly, directly from the Polish Prime Minister Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk, who informed them of the Polish Home Army uprising plans: The Red Army's halt and lack of support for the Polish resistance is seen as a calculated decision by Stalin to achieve certain post-war political objectives. In other words: had the Polish Home Army triumphed, the Polish government-in-exile would have had legitimacy to continue the pre-war government in Poland, rendering the post-war Polish-communists regime invalid and likely rejected in all of the pre-war Polish areas thus far liberated by the Red Army (the news of planned Warsaw Uprising is likely one of the reason of speeding up the installation of communist regime on 22 July 1944 in Lublin). Also the destruction of the main Polish resistance forces by the Germans was of direct benefit to Soviet Union, since it significantly weakened any potential Polish opposition to planned (and already started) Soviet occupation.

As the \"ideal\" communist city, Warsaw was to be decentralized and the need to commute to the city centre reduced. Thus, the Office for the Reconstruction of Warsaw (BOS) commissioned a number of engineers to prepare a project of a fast urban railway (SKM) crossing the city in a deep cutting. Although to a large extent it was to follow the line 1 of the pre-war plans, only the central stations were to be located underground. However, by the end of the decade the project was cancelled. Instead, in 1948 communist planners developed a different concept with the new SKM morphing into a rapid transit line at a depth of up to .

On September 7, the forces of 4th German Panzer Division managed to break the Polish lines near Cz\u0119stochowa and started their march towards Warsaw. Most of the city authorities were evacuated to the east. Warsaw was left with a military garrison composed mainly of infantry battalions and batteries of artillery. The Headquarters of general Czuma had to organize the defense of the city. Unfortunately, there was some misunderstanding among the command. At that time Poland still believed that any time soon Great Britain and France would attack Germany according to the treaties which were signed by these countries at the beginning of 1939. As it happened these obligations were never to materialise. However, at that stage the Polish authorities wanted to preserve younger reservists for future fighting, so the spokesman of the garrison of Warsaw issued a communique in which he ordered all young men to leave the city.

Later in the second war, the term resurfaced between September 1944 and January 1945, when the retreating Germans tried to establish a defense in the city against the advancing Soviet Union. During the invasion of Poland in 1939 the German troops reached the outskirts of Warsaw on 9 September. The Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) assumed that the unfortified city damaged by countless terror bombing raids would be taken by German motorized units without any resistance and issued a press and radio release stating that the capital of Poland was taken.

Officially their status was similar to that of the Municipal Police. The private ownership (most of the shares were held by the city of Warsaw) allowed for fast modernization of the Guards.

The absence of his forces at the battle has been the subject of dispute. A perception arose that his absence was due to his desire to achieve 'military glory' at Lw\u00f3w. Telegrams concerning the transfer of forces were exchanged. Leon Trotsky interpreted Stalin's actions as insubordination; Richard Pipes asserts that Stalin '...almost certainly acted on Lenin's orders' in not moving the forces to Warsaw. That the commander-in-chief Sergey Kamenev allowed such insubordination, issued conflicting and confusing orders and did not act with the decisiveness of a commander-in-chief contributed greatly to the problems and defeat the Red forces suffered at this critical junction of the war. The Polish 5th Army under General W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski counter-attacked on 14 August from the area of the Modlin fortress, crossing the Wkra River. It faced the combined forces of the numerically and materially superior Soviet 3rd and 15th Armies. In one day the Soviet advance toward Warsaw and Modlin had been halted and soon turned into retreat. Sikorski's 5th Army pushed the exhausted Soviet formations away from Warsaw in a lightning operation. Polish forces advanced at a speed of thirty kilometers a day, soon destroying any Soviet hopes for completing their enveloping manoeuvre in the north. By 16 August, the Polish counter-offensive had been fully joined by Marshal Pi\u0142sudski's \"Reserve Army.\" Precisely executing his plan, the Polish force, advancing from Warsaw (Colonel Wrzali\u0144ski's group) and the south (Polish 3rd and 4 Army), found a huge gap between the Soviet fronts and exploited the weakness of the Soviet \"Mozyr Group\" that was supposed to protect the weak link between the Soviet fronts. The Poles continued their northward offensive with two armies following and destroying the surprised enemy. They reached the rear of Tukhachevsky's forces, the majority of which were encircled by 18 August. Only that same day did Tukhachevsky, at his Minsk headquarters 480 kilometres (300 mi) east of Warsaw, become fully aware of the proportions of the Soviet defeat and ordered the remnants of his forces to retreat and regroup. He hoped to straighten his front line, halt the Polish attack, and regain the initiative, but the orders either arrived too late or failed to arrive at all."}, "parent": 0, "overall_score_dict": {"0":

On 1 August, the day of Uprising, the Soviet advance was halted by a direct order from the Kremlin. Soon afterwards the Soviet tank units stopped receiving any oil from their depots. Soviets knew of the planned outbreak from their agents in Warsaw and, more importantly, directly from the Polish Prime Minister Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk, who informed them of the Polish Home Army uprising plans: The Red Army's halt and lack of support for the Polish resistance is seen as a calculated decision by Stalin to achieve certain post-war political objectives. In other words: had the Polish Home Army triumphed, the Polish government-in-exile would have had legitimacy to continue the pre-war government in Poland, rendering the post-war Polish-communists regime invalid and likely rejected in all of the pre-war Polish areas thus far liberated by the Red Army (the news of planned Warsaw Uprising is likely one of the reason of speeding up the installation of communist regime on 22 July 1944 in Lublin). Also the destruction of the main Polish resistance forces by the Germans was of direct benefit to Soviet Union, since it significantly weakened any potential Polish opposition to planned (and already started) Soviet occupation. Halting the advance and taking Warsaw in January 1945 enabled the Soviets to say they \"liberated\" Warsaw."}, "parent": 0, "overall_score_dict": {"0": {"final_score": 1.719481143304054,

A minority of leaders in the Deep South, including Alexander Stephens, opposed secession before Lincoln made a move that would threaten slavery in the Southern states. However, the wide popularity of secession in the Deep South precluded delay until after Lincoln took office.

Initially, the seven Deep South states seceded, with economies based on cotton (then in heavy European demand with rising prices). They were Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas. After the Confederates attacked and captured Fort Sumter, President Lincoln called for volunteers to march south and suppress the rebellion. This pushed the four other Upper South States (Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas) also to secede. These states completed the formation of the Confederate States of America.

The Battle of First Bull Run or Battle of First Manassas, the first major battle of the war, occurred on July 21, 1861.
